    <h1>Hey, I'm m4rrc0</h1>
    <p>This is my contribution to the web. Impressive, right?!</p>
    <p>
      As you can see there is not much here yet but the goal is to build and

      I have been teaching myself web development for approximately 5 years now.
      Among other things I have been freelancing and creating a
      <a href="https://github.com/toile-webstack/gatsby-site-builder">
        proto jamstack website builder
      </a>
      .

    <p>
      These wanderings lead me to a lot of reflexion about what I'll call the
      <em>personal web.</em>
      A place on the web for you, that belongs to you and that you can control
      as much as you can (even if you are not a techie).
    </p>
    <p>
      This comes with a lot of challenges but I believe we have everything we
      need to make it happen. Sure, new protocols and complicated tech could
      probably help but I will leave that to smarter people. In the meantime I
      truly believe that a more open web is just a burst of motivation away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's use some comon sense low-tech stack. And let's start a small
      revolution where anyone can just easily creates its personal space on the
      web and connect with others.

      The goal of this website is to build my personal space and to be the
      sandbox to create tooling for anyone to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have got a lot of unfinished (and unstarted) articles and code snippets
      lying around. Hopefully there is value in it and taking the time to share
      will benefit everyone (including me).

    <p>Feedbacks are greatly appreciated.</p>
    <p>Take care.</p>
