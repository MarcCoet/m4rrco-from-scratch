  That
  <strong>freaking fox</strong>
  makes me
  <em>crazy...</em>
  <strong>
    <em>crazy about her!</em>
  </strong>
  <br />
  Jumping
  <code>over the fence</code>
  is such a
  <a href="#">bad habit</a>
  for a rabbit. It's like jumping over a
  <code>{'<hr />'}</code>
  disregarding its
  <code>margin</code>
  .
