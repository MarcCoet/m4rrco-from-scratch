# The web is full of sh\*t!

Our everyday life on the web is made of clunky, buggy, overloaded proprietary tools.

According to Google Research (and [this article](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/)), in 2017

> the average time it takes to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds.

[This article](https://kinsta.com/blog/zero-carbon-websites/) points out that according to [WebsiteCarbon.com](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)'s data

> The average website produces 6.8 grams of CO2 per page view. [...] An average website with 10,000 page views per month would produce 816kg of CO2 per year. That’s **more than the emissions produced by a flight from London to Tokyo**.

If you look for it on the web, you will see that more and more people are looking for (or would be open to) alternatives to facebook. [This article](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/5/17824116/delete-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-break-time-well-spent) for example highlights the decreasing trust of the general public towards facebook.

## What are you gonna do 'bout it?

**I am going to create a fµck\*ng easy way for anyone to create modern, sustainable websites for free (or very cheap) while owning their own data!!**

Anyone will be able to reclaim their identity on the web and create their own social circle with no strings attached (except with love ones of course ;) ).

## Yeah yeah... and I will be eating swedish sushis on the moon with the president of the US tomorrow

Don't believe me? I am actually half way there!

3 years ago (I was approx. 2 years into programming) I built [toile.io](https://www.toile.io/) as a way for my clients to edit their own [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites and for me to automate website creation a little bit. Now, the project is [free and open source](https://github.com/toile-webstack/gatsby-site-builder).

It is a prototype and it leaves a lot of space for improvement. The thing is that, even though this particular project has not evolved as much as I would have liked it to, I have been obsessed with this idea for 3 years! And I have got a lot of ideas and code snippets lying around waiting to find their rightful place in this project.

## Hhmm... so what are you gonna build?

My plan is to re-start from scratch and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). The goal for my personal website is to be the sandbox to experiment with new features and a showcase of my peregrination.

My guiding principles for this 'website builder' project:

- non-tech users should be at ease creating their website (at some point)
- power users should be able to produce the same (or higher) quality website as they would when coding them from scratch
- smart ejectable defaults for every part of the project from design to backend choices
- opinionated decisions with as much modularity as possible. I want to be able to replace some part of the code or some tech decision with something else easily
- being as low tech as convenient
- using as much open tech as convenient
- using available tech to test ideas before developing something custom
- doing it for myself and for bringing something valuable to the world
- host your own or mutualize to make it easy and cheap
- write about it while I build
- content has to be separated from the code base
- themes should be separated as well
- ... (more will come as I build)

The moving parts, things to explore and build upon (in no particular order):

- service workers
- data structure for the web (and the brain?)
- simplify design choices
- on-page wysiwyg editing 2.0
- zero emission website
- personal hub on the web
- resource mutualization and data ownership
- indie web
- semantic web
- ...

Current roadmap:

- [ ] put this thing online
  - no style
  - basic html
- [ ] mailing list and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/m4rrco)
  - embedded form for mailing list
- [ ] first article on "basic html setup"
- [ ] smallest setup to be productive
  - ? Eleventy ?
  - ? custom svelte compile to html ?
- [ ] research how I could have wysiwyg on-page edit. Can I code a POC in 1 day?
- [ ] should I use files or
- [ ] ...
