Modularizing is about finding the interfaces inside of your code base.
You find interfaces by asking yourself what parts of your code you may want to reuse in another project or what tool you may want to replace at some point.

Questions to ask yourself:

- what if I change this tool?
- what if I change the programming language?
- could I use this part of the code in another project?

I guess you don't really know how to modularize until you are faced with your first big refactoring.
