## What does it take

- data structure (both for CMS and website structure)
- theming system
  - colors
  - typography
  - components
  - custom styles
- build system
  - fast
  - only triggered on demand to reduce energy consumption
- code base separated from data
- CMS
  - ideally should be static files hosted anywhere we want (Next cloud, Gaia storage, Google Drive, Dropbox, ...)
    - Needs a lot of dev to get there because we have to create a graphDB-like system from flat files
  -

## Vision

- zero emission
- power of composition with few intentional limitations so that the content creator have very little ways to screw up the design
